Title: Integration Process

Data Integration:
The integration process involved exporting data from the MySQL database in CSV format and importing it into Excel for analysis and visualization.
Steps:
Data was exported using SQL queries that saved the data as CSV files.
These CSV files were then imported into Excel, where they were used to create pivot tables, charts, and the interactive dashboard.
Data Consistency:
Ensuring data consistency was a critical step. We compared the values in the database with those in Excel to ensure accuracy. Any discrepancies were identified and corrected to maintain data integrity.
